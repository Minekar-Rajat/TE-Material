Q)Given IP address and bits reserved for network id and number of 
subnets,Find the address of hosts under each subnet. 
	
Steps: 

1.Take input for the Network address, bits reserved for network 
ID and number of subnets . 

2.Find Network Mask from the given bits and assign remaining bits 
as zero. 

3.Then borrow the bits from this network mask for using them in 
finding subnet Ids. 

4.If n subnets are given then borrow m bits such that 2^m = n. 

5.Find all the combinations of the borrowed bits and assign them 
with Network address. 

6.From this you will get all the possible subnet addresses. 

7.You can find the sunbet mask by making all the borrowed bits 1 
in the network mask. 

8.Take any two addresses as input from the given set of subnet 
address from the user. 

9.Then output whether those are reachable or not.
